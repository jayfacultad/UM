Acknowledgment of help received during this assignment: we asked for help from 
several of the COMP40 TA's during their office hours, and they were an 
invaluable resource.

/*****************************************************************************
*
*   Final um
*
*****************************************************************************/

Explain what routine in the final um takes up the most time, and say whether
the assembly code could be improved.

Our final um has Seq_get and UArray_at as the routines that use the greatest
amount of time. Seq_get and UArray_at take 16.12% and 11.56% of 
execute_instructions total time, respectively, where execute_instructions is 
99.62% of the total cpu use time.

Our Assembly code can't be improved significantly, as our current jumps are
all required for the UM to function properly. Inside the 
execute_instructions, we require the while loop jumps to execute all of the
instructions, and to avoid accessing memory past the current segment. The if
statement jumps are required to iterate the program counter without accessing 
memory past the current segment index.

We moved unnecessary computations outside the loop (additional details in the 
labnotes). Additionally, the number of memory reads (and writes) were reduced 
when we removed variables storing pointers that were only accessed once per
function. The elimination of function calls inside our while loop also
reduced the number of memory accesses significantly.

Approximately 8 hours were spent analyzing the problems posed in the 
assignment.  
Approximately 4 hours were spent solving the problems after analysis.
