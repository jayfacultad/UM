Lab 11: Profiling Tools

Please put answers to questions here.

  * What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
    black edges? 

        42.89% for remove_black_edges
        14.19% for putc and read_raw_bit
  
  * How long does
  
       time ./unblackedges 
  
    take?

        0.72 seconds for user time
        0.83 seconds for elapsed
  
  * After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
    happened to the total time?

        The changes reduced user time to 0.70 seconds
        The changes reduced elapsed to 0.74 seconds
  
  * What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?

        Original Bit_put was 16.85%
        Optimized Bit_put is 16.9%
  
  * Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
    changed?
  
        The system time was reduced from 0.01 seconds to 0.00 seconds. 
        This system time involves I/O, where most of the program's time is 
        spent.  A small improvement in the system time yields a significant
        improvement in the overall program time.
